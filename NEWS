2011-05-23:
   * Fixes to get redhat packaging to work on centos, fedora, scilinux, and opensuse.

     and recover any valid extents from it.

2010-08-21:

2010-02-15:
   * Release

2010-02-15:
   * Add program for testing out the world cup data using the Avro file format.

     group by variable.

2009-12-01:
   * Release

2009-11-01:
   * Return type of registerType changed to ExtentType & from ExtentType *
     since it can never be null.

     type in order to operate.

2009-09-27:
   * Extend dsstatgroupby so that it doesn't need to have a group by column.

2009-09-18:

     additional time on this after feedback that a user guide is more useful.

2009-07-15:
   * Factor the SortedIndex out of the SortedIndexModule so that a single index
     can be shared across multiple modules.

2009-06-16:

     bear traces using DataSeries. doc/fast2009-nfs-analysis

2009-01-02:
   * operator () added to fields for easier use.
   * Added analysis/nfs/ipnfscrosscheck to compare the packets in the
     IP and NFS traces.  This analysis conservatively identifies
     un-converted packets.

2008-12-12:
   * Extensive documentation patch from Steven Watanabe.

2008-12-04:
   * Updates to srt2ds, cmpsrtds, cmpsrtds.pm to convert cello-1999
     traces (32 bit only)

2008-12-01:
   * --where option added to dsselect

2008-11-10:
   * Final version of the Operating Systems Review paper "DataSeries:
     An Efficient, Flexible Data Format for Structured Serial Data"

2008-09-12:
   * Add sequentiality analysis to nfsdsanalysis.
   * Add analysis that looks for gaps in the transaction id sequence to
     nfsdsanalysis.

2008-09-10:

     ipdsanalysis.

2008-09-07:
   * Add firstExtent() function to RowAnalysisModule

2008-09-05:
   * Extend Extent class to record file and offset of extents -- useful

     nfsdsanalysis
   * Add option to print out merged and base series in nfsdsanalysis

2008-08-28:
   * Add sql output mode for HostInfo analysis in nfsdsanalysis

2008-07-28:
   * Add analysis of the 1998 World Cup traces; update TR to include
     analysis.
   * Add support for templated fixed fields that can be significantly
     faster than the non-templated ones for very simple analysis.

2008-07-09:
   * Add support for many different operations and comparisons in the
     expression support of dsstatgroupby.

2008-06-26:
   * Add support for --where to ds2txt

2008-06-14:
   * DataSeries should now build on cygwin.

2008-06-12:
   * nfsdsanalysis should work on the v1.0, v2.0, v2.1 trace files.

2008-05-19:
   * DataSeries has switched over to using .hpp for the header names.  .H
     files are still present for transition; a warning will be present for
     one release and then the transitional files will be removed.

2008-05-09:
   * Switched over to using cmake for building instead of autoconf.  This
     change is intended to move us toward being able to build on Windows.
   * Added support for building and installing doxygen based documentation.

2008-04-14:
   * Created code to convert the 1998 World Cup traces and to perform the
     same analysis as shipped with the data.

2008-04-07:
   * Added a new packing option pack_pad_record to avoid rounding records
     up to 8 bytes.
   * Added a new packing option pack_field_ordering to control the order
     used for packing fields.

2008-04-02:
   * Added the Int64TimeField class to start dealing with the problems of
     different units for times.  Used primarily in the NFS analysis since
     those have different time units.

2008-03-28:
   * You can now set the name of a field after the constructor.

2008-03-26:
   * Added the lindump-mmap raw collection program.  lindump-mmap is
     roughly twice as efficient at doing packet capture as tcpdump, but
     is linux specific.

2008-02-27:
   * Fix up nfsds host analysis module, useful for figuring out how many
     operations are going in/out of each of the hosts.  Example of how to make
     a plot is included in src/analysis/nfs/mod1.cpp

2008-01-27:
   * Add in doc/tr; the technical report we've been writing.  Includes the
     writeup of the Ellard work.

2008-01-21:
   * Tune parallel reading; potentially more to be done.

2008-01-08:
   * Make ExtentType const everywhere; this allows us to use it in more places,
     but requires users to change their code.

2008-01-04:
   * Add support for parallel reading in the IndexSourceModule's.  Has tuning
     parameters for size of uncompressed and compressed data to be prefetching.

2007-12-31:
   * Three programs for working with the Daniel Ellard Harvard NFS traces have
     been implemented and tested on the home04 set of traces.  ellardnfs2ds
     converts the data from the Ellard text format to dataseries format.
     ds2ellardnfs converts the data from dataseries back to the Ellard
     text format.  ellardanalysis implements the first three example questions
     in nfsscan-v0.16-040509/EXAMPLES.  There is also a batch-parallel
     module for converting the Ellard traces, it will convert the traces to
     dataseries and check that the conversion was correct by converting back.
     When both formats are compressed using gzip, the DataSeries files are
     approximately 0.76x the size of the text ones.  Analysis runs 76-107x
     faster on a 4 core machine, and uses about 25x less cpu time.

2007-12-28:
   * Null compacting has been implemented.  This performs a transform on the
     fixed data that removes all of the null data and only leaves the boolean
     to indicate the value is null.  It is used as part of the Ellard nfs
     traces.  Null compaction is enabled by putting
     pack_null_compact="non_bool" in as an option for the extent type.  Use of
     it currently generates a warning; the warning will be removed once null
     compaction is tried with a second data type.

2007-12-07:
   * Extent ExtentType matching to be substring so we don't have to remember
     the entire name for programs like ds2txt and dsstatgroupby.

2007-11-05:
   * nfsdsanalysis program added, only one of the analysis has been tested,
     so it is the only one enabled.
   * NEWS file created

2007-10-30:
   * dstypes2cxx gets a mode that automatically generates a row analysis
     module; this is probably how you want to make an initial program.

2007-10-11:
   * Add in lsfdsplots -- a program that uses lsfdsanalysis to generate graphs.
   * Add in dsdecrypt -- a program that can detect and decrypt encrypted strings
     in DataSeries files.

2007-10-02:
   * Add in initial where clause support to dsstatgroupby.

2007-09-30:
   * Add in lsfdsanalysis program for analyzing LSF batch accounting logs

2007-09-27:
   * Add in filesystem enumerator.  Useful for finding all of the files that
     are not in use; this can then be combined with tcpdump and
     nettrace2ds to get ds files
   * Add in host pinger so we can detect which file servers are local.

2007-09-26:
   * dsrepack batch-parallel module so we can repack in parallel over a
     directory hierarchy

2007-09-15:
   * Switch license to BSD.
   * Add support for general expressions to dsstatgroupby.

2007-09-11:
   * Add support for parallel compression.  As a side effect this means that
     writing to data series files does not impact latency much because
     compression happens in a separate thread.

2007-09-01:
   * Optimize extent reading to avoid zeroing byte arrays when it's unnecessary.

2007-08-30:
   * Extend dsrepack so that it can split files into multiple pieces.

2007-08-28:
   * Change defaults on validating checksums so that we only do validation
     if things are otherwise going to be slow (e.g. dsrepack, ds2txt), or if
     the user sets the environment variable.

2007-08-07:
   * iphost2ds.C: new program for converting ip hostnames pairs into
     dataseries.

2007-08-02:
   * bacct2ds.C: new program for converting LSF batch accounting logs
     into dataseries.  Also parses job names and directories to extract out
     some site-specific features.

2007-04-20:
   * Use a chained checksum rather than a random value in the tail of the file
     so cmp will agree files are identical.
   * Add support for version numbers and namespaces to ExtentType
   * Add support to process pcap files in nettrace2ds

2007-02-23:
   * Add nettrace2ds batch-parallel module so we can do big runs over
     many files.

2007-01-08:
   * New dsstatgroupby program and module for calculating statistics over
     an expression grouped by a column.  Initial expressions very limited.

2007-01-05:
   * Import liblzf-1.6 into DataSeries so we will always have that compression
     algorithm.

2007-01-02:
   * Rename all the includes to be #include <DataSeries/...>

2006-12-26:
   * Implement dsrepack that lets you take a dataseries file and repack it
     into another file with different extent size and compression options.
