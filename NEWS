2008-03-26:
  * Added the lindump-mmap raw collection program.  lindump-mmap is
    roughly twice as efficient at doing packet capture as tcpdump, but
    is linux specific.

2008-02-27:
  * Fix up nfsds host analysis module, useful for figuring out how many 
    operations are going in/out of each of the hosts.  Example of how to make
    a plot is included in src/analysis/nfs/mod1.cpp

2008-01-27:
  * Add in doc/tr; the technical report we've been writing.  Includes the
    writeup of the Ellard work.

2008-01-21: 
  * Tune parallel reading; potentially more to be done.

2008-01-08:
  * Make ExtentType const everywhere; this allows us to use it in more places,
    but requires users to change their code.

2008-01-04:
  * Add support for parallel reading in the IndexSourceModule's.  Has tuning
    parameters for size of uncompressed and compressed data to be prefetching.

2007-12-31: 
  * Three programs for working with the Daniel Ellard Harvard NFS traces have
    been implemented and tested on the home04 set of traces.  ellardnfs2ds
    converts the data from the Ellard text format to dataseries format.
    ds2ellardnfs converts the data from dataseries back to the Ellard
    text format.  ellardanalysis implements the first three example questions
    in nfsscan-v0.16-040509/EXAMPLES.  There is also a batch-parallel
    module for converting the Ellard traces, it will convert the traces to
    dataseries and check that the conversion was correct by converting back.
    When both formats are compressed using gzip, the DataSeries files are
    approximately 0.76x the size of the text ones.  Analysis runs 76-107x
    faster on a 4 core machine, and uses about 25x less cpu time.

2007-12-28: 
  * Null compacting has been implemented.  This performs a transform on the
    fixed data that removes all of the null data and only leaves the boolean
    to indicate the value is null.  It is used as part of the Ellard nfs
    traces.  Null compaction is enabled by putting 
    pack_null_compact="non_bool" in as an option for the extent type.  Use of
    it currently generates a warning; the warning will be removed once null
    compaction is tried with a second data type.

2007-12-07:
  * Extent ExtentType matching to be substring so we don't have to remember
    the entire name for programs like ds2txt and dsstatgroupby.

2007-11-05:
  * nfsdsanalysis program added, only one of the analysis has been tested,
    so it is the only one enabled.
  * NEWS file created

2007-10-30:
  * dstypes2cxx gets a mode that automatically generates a row analysis 
    module; this is probably how you want to make an initial program.

2007-10-11:
  * Add in lsfdsplots -- a program that uses lsfdsanalysis to generate graphs.
  * Add in dsdecrypt -- a program that can detect and decrypt encrypted strings
    in DataSeries files.

2007-10-02:
  * Add in initial where clause support to dsstatgroupby.

2007-09-30:
  * Add in lsfdsanalysis program for analyzing LSF batch accounting logs

2007-09-27:
  * Add in filesystem enumerator.  Useful for finding all of the files that
    are not in use; this can then be combined with tcpdump and
    nettrace2ds to get ds files
  * Add in host pinger so we can detect which file servers are local.

2007-09-26:
  * dsrepack batch-parallel module so we can repack in parallel over a 
    directory hierarchy

2007-09-15:
  * Switch license to BSD.
  * Add support for general expressions to dsstatgroupby.

2007-09-11:
  * Add support for parallel compression.  As a side effect this means that
    writing to data series files does not impact latency much because
    compression happens in a separate thread.

2007-09-01:
  * Optimize extent reading to avoid zeroing byte arrays when it's unnecessary.

2007-08-30:
  * Extend dsrepack so that it can split files into multiple pieces.

2007-08-28:
  * Change defaults on validating checksums so that we only do validation
    if things are otherwise going to be slow (e.g. dsrepack, ds2txt), or if
    the user sets the environment variable.

2007-08-07:
  * iphost2ds.C: new program for converting ip hostnames pairs into
    dataseries.

2007-08-02:
  * bacct2ds.C: new program for converting LSF batch accounting logs
    into dataseries.  Also parses job names and directories to extract out
    some site-specific features.

2007-04-20:
  * Use a chained checksum rather than a random value in the tail of the file
    so cmp will agree files are identical.
  * Add support for version numbers and namespaces to ExtentType
  * Add support to process pcap files in nettrace2ds

2007-02-23: 
  * Add nettrace2ds batch-parallel module so we can do big runs over
    many files.

2007-01-08:
  * New dsstatgroupby program and module for calculating statistics over
    an expression grouped by a column.  Initial expressions very limited.

2007-01-05:
  * Import liblzf-1.6 into DataSeries so we will always have that compression 
    algorithm.

2007-01-02:
  * Rename all the includes to be #include <DataSeries/...>

2006-12-26:
  * Implement dsrepack that lets you take a dataseries file and repack it 
    into another file with different extent size and compression options.
