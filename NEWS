  * Three programs for working with the Daniel Ellard Harvard NFS traces have
    been implemented and tested on the home04 set of traces.  ellardnfs2ds
    converts the data from the Ellard text format to dataseries format.
    ds2ellardnfs converts the data from dataseries back to the Ellard
    text format.  ellardanalysis implements the first three example questions
    in nfsscan-v0.16-040509/EXAMPLES.  There is also a batch-parallel
    module for converting the Ellard traces, it will convert the traces to
    dataseries and check that the conversion was correct by converting back.
    When both formats are compressed using gzip, the DataSeries files are
    approximately 1.41x smaller than the text onces.  When compressed with lzo,
    analysis runs in about 30x less cpu-time using DataSeries.

2007-12-28: 
  * Null compacting has been implemented.  This performs a transform on the
    fixed data that removes all of the null data and only leaves the boolean
    to indicate the value is null.  It is used as part of the Ellard nfs
    traces.  Null compaction is enabled by putting 
    pack_null_compact="non_bool" in as an option for the extent type.  Use of
    it currently generates a warning; the warning will be removed once null
    compaction is tried with a second data type.

  * nfsdsanalysis program added, only one of the analysis has been tested,
    so it is the only one enabled.
  * NEWS file created
