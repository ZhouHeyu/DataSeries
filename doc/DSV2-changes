At some point we want to change the underlying file format for dataseries.
The plan is to call this DSV2 as it would encompass changes that cannot
be made within the DSV1 format.

Changes under consideration for DSV1:
  * Change the extent type and extent index types to conform to the new
    naming convention
  * Add in a bunch of information about the stored extents into the extent
    index; see DataSeriesFile.C for the current proposal.

Changes under consideration for DSV2:
  * Update the checksums that are used.  Current suggestion is to use SHA1
    for the packed checksum, and adler32/zlib-crc32/bjhash for the unpacked
    checksum with the modification that unpacked checksums aren't checked
    by default.
  * Change the part of the extent header that stores the type as a string
    to storing the type as a 2-4 byte id this will reduce the overhead for
    having small extents, although it will require us to assign a permanant
    range for the built-in types and any future ones.  The id's would then
    be stored in the extent-type extent
  * Add in a part of the extent structure for storing transform rules.
    This will allow us to remove the transform rules from the extent type,
    and enable per-extent rules, which could lead to better compression.
    Shouldn't need a unpacked fixed size as record size * nrecords should
    be bigger than that.
