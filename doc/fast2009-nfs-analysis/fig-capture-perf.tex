\caption{Bandwidth measured in the collection process.  In Figure (b),
anim-2007/set-5 at different intervals is the top group of 4 lines, and
anim-2003/set-12 is the bottom group of 4 lines. With 60s intervals, 
anim-2003/set-12 does not show the 0.9999 quantile 
because there were insufficient data points.}
