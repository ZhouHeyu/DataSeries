We describe methods to capture, convert, store and analyze NFS
workloads that are 20-100$\times$ more intense, in terms of
operations/day, than any previously published.
%
We describe three techniques that improve capture performance by up to
$10\times$ over previous techniques.
%
For conversion, we use a general-purpose format that is both highly
space efficient and provides efficient access to the trace data.
%
For
analysis, we describe a number of techniques adopted from the
database community and some new techniques that facilitate analysis of 
very large traces.
%
We also describe a number of guidelines for trace collection that should
prove useful to future practitioners.
%
Finally, we analyze a commercial feature
animation (movie) rendering workload using these techniques and discuss the
characteristics of the workload.
%
Our implementation of these techniques is available as open source
and the exact anonymized datasets we analyze are available for free download.
