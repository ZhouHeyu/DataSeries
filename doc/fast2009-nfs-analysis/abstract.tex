We describe the challenges of capturing, converting, storing and
analyzing NFS workloads that are 20-100$\times$ more intense than those previously
published.  We describe three techniques that improve capture performance
by up to $10\times$ over previous techniques.  
%
For conversion we describe our tool, and 
provide a number of guidelines for future trace collection that should
prove useful to future practitioners.
%
We convert 
to a general-purpose format that is both highly space efficient and provides 
efficient access to stored data.
%
For
analysis, we describe both a number of techniques adopted from the
database community and some new techniques, that enable analysis of 
very large traces.
%
Finally, we analyze a commercial feature
animation (movie) rendering workload using these techniques and discuss the
characteristics of the workload.
%
We have open sourced our implementation of these techniques, and provided
the exact anonymnized datasets we analyzed for this paper for free download.
