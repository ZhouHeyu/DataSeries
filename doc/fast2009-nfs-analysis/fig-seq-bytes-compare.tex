\caption{Each line group shows host estimated sequentiality was affected by allowing, in order: 
reordering of I/Os within 10ms of the
reply, reordering within the request-reply window, or no reordering.
The small horizontal change shows that reordering 
this workload has a negligible effect on sequentiality.}
