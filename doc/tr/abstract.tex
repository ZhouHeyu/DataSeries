In this paper we describe
\DataSeries{}, an on-disk data format and run-time library that is
optimized for analyzing \textit{structured serial data}, which we

We discuss how \DataSeries{} has been optimized to be extremely space and CPU
efficient, while providing the flexibility to accommodate a very wide
range of record structures.

We then validate our claims on a variety of storage trace data. 
In particular, we show
data compression rates several times better than existing, specialized
formats, processing rate improvements of up to an order of
magnitude, storage of hundreds of billions of records and that
