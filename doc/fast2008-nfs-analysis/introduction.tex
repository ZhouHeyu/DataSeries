The datasets we have collected were collected at a feature animation
(movie) company\footnote{The customer name will remain blinded as part
of the agreement to publish the traces} during two other projects.
The first dataset was collected between fall 2003 and spring 2004.  We
returned later to collect data in fall 2006-spring 2007 using an
improved version of our technology.  We collected data using mirror
ports on the customer's, and we mirrored a variety of different places
in the network.  The customers network design is straightforward: They
have a redundant core set of routers, an optional mid-tier of switches
to increase the effective port count of the core, and then a
collection of edge switches that each cover one or two racks of
rendering machines.  Most of our traces were taken by mirroring at
those rendering clients.
