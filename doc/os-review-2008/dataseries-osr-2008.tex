\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Traces, recordings and measurements taken from computer systems,
networks and scientific infrastructure are vitally important for a
large variety of tasks. In every area of computer system design,
traces from existing systems have been used to validate hypotheses,
test assumptions and estimate performance. This is true of I/O
subsystems~\cite{IORef,Ji03,Uysal03}, processor
systems~\cite{ProcRef}, network systems~\cite{NetRef} and memory
systems~\cite{MemRef}, among others. Traces and logs are also
extremely useful for fault-finding, auditing and debugging purposes
~\cite{DebugRef}. Traces composed of failure data have been used to
determine system reliability~\cite{ReliabilityRef, Schroeder07,
Pinheiro07}. Trend analyses of performance information is a core
operation of various management tools~\cite{MgmtRef}. Scientific and
medical instrumentation can also generate large amounts of
data~\cite{SciRef}, which also needs to be stored, filtered and
analyzed.

The data stored in each of these diverse uses is {\it structured
serial data}, which we define as a series of records, each record
having a specified structure (i.e., containing the same set of
variables or fields). Structured serial data has four defining characteristics:
its structure is record-oriented; it is typically written only once,
and is read many times; it is usually ordered
in some manner, e.g., chronologically; and it is typically read
sequentially.  We have designed and built DataSeries, an on-disk 
data format, run-time library, and set of
tools that is optimized for storing and analyzing this type of data.
We show that the performance of DataSeries
exceeds the performance of common trace formats and databases by at
least a factor of two, and in some cases up to an order of
magnitude. DataSeries also requires far less disk space (factors vary
from 4x to 8x in test data sets).

% which we define as an ordered series of records that share a common
% structure.  This type of data commonly occurs as trace data in
% computer systems, but since the format is essentially ordered RDBMS
% tables, the need to maintain and analyze such data occurs in a large
% number of scientific fields.

We desire six key properties of a data format and analysis system for
structured serial data:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Storage efficiency}: the data should be stored in as few
bytes as possible. There are several driving factors behind this
requirement. Firstly, the amount of data stored can be large (we have
I/O traces comprising billions of records), and despite rapidly
decreasing storage prices, the cost to store data can still be
considerable, particularly when the data must be kept for long periods
of time. Secondly, we have learned that one of the primary factors
behind analysis efficiency is the speed at which data can be
retrieved. Regardless of the storage technology used, more highly
compressed data can substantially speed access times.

\item \textbf{Access efficiency}: accessing, interpreting and encoding
trace data, whether reading or writing, should make efficient use of
CPU and memory resources. From experience and experimental analysis,
we have learned that the second major factor determining analysis
efficiency is the CPU overheads of intepreting data once it has been
read off disk.

\item \textbf{Flexibility}: adding additional fields should not affect
users of the trace data.  Removing or modifying data fields should
only affect programs that use those fields, and the system should
catch incorrect usage.  Further, the format should not constrain
the type of data being stored, and should allow multiple record types
in a single file. Again, experience has taught us that formats that
are not flexible lead to severe maintenance issues for both the format
interpretation code and analysis systems.

\item \textbf{Self-describing}: the data set should contain the
metadata that describes the data. This is another experience-driven
requirement, as we have had problems in trying to interpret and use
trace data from other organizations, and maintaining organizational
knowledge of our own metadata over time.

\item \textbf{Usability}: the data format should have an
associated programming interface that is both expressive and easy to
use. In particular the user model of the data and its analysis should
be easy to describe and the interface to it should easily allow for
common operations (e.g., scanning an entire data set, and processing
specific fields only).

\item \textbf{Integrity}: many structured serial data files are 
intended as archival traces. To protect against media
errors or incorrect software systems, DataSeries files need to be
self-contained and contain internal checksums that enable
integrity checking.

\end{enumerate}

There are, inevitably, tradeoffs to be made in these requirements. For
instance, XML is an extremely flexible data format, but is not very
efficient. In the course of our work (which tends towards the analysis
of very large data sets), and the design of DataSeries, we have chosen
to prioritize efficiency over many of the other properties.

Although numerous tracing and measurement systems have been developed
over the last 20-30 years, we are not aware of any that meet all of
these requirements. We analyze some of these in our description of
related work (Section~\ref{sec:related}).

We provide four primary contributions in this paper.  First, we
introduce DataSeries, a data format and associated library, which was
specifically designed to meet the five key properties discussed above,
and relate some of the experiences that led us to make various
design decisions. 
Second, we discuss how DataSeries can support very large data sets
(e.g., hundreds of billions of records) on modest systems.  Third, we
describe how we have used DataSeries in practice to store a wide
variety of data types.  Fourth, we demonstrate the performance and
storage efficiency of DataSeries in a set of controlled experiments,
using empirical data sets. Throughout, we have tried to emphasize the
lessons learned and how they might be applied to other fields.

DataSeries software is publicly available under a BSD license from \texttt{http://tesla.hpl.hp.com/opensource/}. Given the benefits of DataSeries that we demonstrate, we
argue that DataSeries should be considered for use by any application
that needs to store large amounts of structured serial data. Indeed
the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) I/O traces tools
and analysis (IOTTA) technical working group~\cite{iotta-website} has
proposed DataSeries as the standard format for I/O trace data.
% and is
% currently specifying the semantics for I/O traces encoded using DataSeries.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:related} describes the strengths and weaknesses of
existing storage technologies relative to DataSeries.
Section~\ref{sec:design} describes the design of DataSeries, including
on-disk and in-memory formats, and introduces the programming model.

from our use of DataSeries to illustrate and quantify the benefits of
DataSeries. Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} concludes the
paper with a summary of our work.

\section{Related work}\label{sec:related}

We classify the related work into three categories:
those that use a customized binary format, those that use a
text-based format, and relational database systems. 
For more complete comparisons including performance
results, please refer to~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.

Custom binary formats are usually serialized or directly written
versions of an in-memory data structure.  As such, they usually
achieve storage efficiency and access efficiency, and fail to achieve
flexibility, self-describing, usability, and integrity, although as we
will show in the results, unless the authors are careful they can also
fail to achieve access efficiency.

Text formats such as Column Separated Value (CSV) can
%often (but far from always)
achieve flexibility and self-describing. XML achieves flexibility,
self-describing, usability, and mostly integrity.  However, they fail
to achieve storage efficiency, and can fail access efficiency by
multiple orders of magnitude.  Even very tuned CSV implementations can
only get to within 2-7x the access-efficiency of DataSeries, and 4-7x
for the storage efficiency.
% (See the DataSeries technical 
%report~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot} for these results.)
%{\bf TODO: need to re-do these experiments at least to
%measure the file sizes, and potentially with Tfrac text files,
%although I suspect people would use sec.usec in a block I/O trace}

Relational databases achieve properties flexibility, self-describing,
usability, and integrity. RDBMS's were designed to handle updates, so
do very limited compression drastically hurting their storage
efficiency.  Our
results show $>$10x improvement on storage efficiency for DataSeries
over MySQL.
%{\bf TODO: check the exact sizes, should be around there.}
Similarly, the generality of SQL can hurt it.  Even for fairly simple
queries running entirely on in-memory data, DataSeries runs 2-7x
faster than MySQL. 
%{\bf TODO: re-do these numbers with parallel
%decompression, etc.}  
Retrieving the data for a more complicated
calculation on the client would further slow the relative performance.

\section{Design}\label{sec:design}

DataSeries' data model is conceptually very similar to that used by
relational databases.  Logically, a DataSeries file is composed of an
ordered sequence of {\it records}, where each record is composed from
a set of {\it fields}. Each field has a {\it field-type} (e.g.,
integer, string, double, boolean) and a name. A DataSeries record is
analogous to a row in a conventional relational database. For
efficiency, we group a set of rows that have the same fields and field
types into an extent.  We call the type of that extent the {\it
extent-type}.  Usually an analysis will be run over a collection of
extents, so a collection of extents of the same type is similar to a
database table.

\subsection{Data format}

A single DataSeries file comprises one or more extents
(potentially with different extent-types), plus a header and
extent-type extent at the beginning of the file, and an index extent
and trailer at the end of the file. The header on a DataSeries file 
contains the DataSeries
file version, and check values that enable the reader to determine the
endianness encodings of the data types.  DataSeries files are always
written out using the native formats of the writing system. This 
typically minimizes byte-swapping overheads, as the architecture 
reading the files is almost always the same as the architecture reading
the files. The library transparently converts in the rare cases this
is not true, and DataSeries files can be explicitly ``repacked'' if desired. 

The extent-type extent contains records with a single string-valued
field, each of which contains an XML specification that defines the
extent-types of all the other extents in the file. We chose to use XML
to define our extent types because we saw no point in creating a new
grammar for representing this information, it is flexible (for
instance, it easily allows the addition of options describing
fields) and allows embedded comments.
% and SQL create table
% statements did not have a representation for the packing options we
% wanted to specify.

The trailer
consists of the offset and size (after compression) of the index
extent.  The offset is used to read the index extent, which has two
fields, an extent-type and an offset, to allow direct access to
extents of a single type. Storing the index and trailer at the end
of the file enable efficient writing, since writing applications will
often not know, a priori, what the final extent sizes will be, so space 
for the index cannot be allocated until after the extents have been written.

Each extent consists of a header, followed by the fixed sized fields
and separately the variable sized data.  A reference to the variable
sized data from the fixed size fields allows for variable sized
fields.  This separation allows for direct access to fixed sized
fields since they will be at a known offset, and one indirection to
get at the variable sized data.  Both fixed and variable sized data
may be compressed, using any one of a number of standard compression
algorithms~\cite{BZIP,GZIP,LZF,LZO}.  The extent header contains
metadata about the data in the extent, such as the compressed sizes of
the fixed and variable data, the number of records in the extent, the
uncompressed size of the variable length data, the compression mode,
the extent-type of the extent, and checksums of the extent before and
after compression to guard against hardware and software errors.
Programs usually disable checksum validation during extent reading to
improve performance at the cost of reduced integrity.

The extent format is designed for efficient access. Values are packed
so that once an extent is read into memory, an analysis can iterate
over the rows simply by increasing a single counter, as if for an
array containing structures.  Individual values are accessed by an
offset from that counter and a C++ cast operation. This technique
could be applicable to anyone storing similar data, e.g. RPC fields or
a streaming RDBMS.

As we initially built DataSeries prototypes, we realized the need to
add options that control various aspects of the field and extent
descriptions in order to meet the storage and access efficiency and
flexibility requirements.  While space precludes a full description
(see~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}), we describe some of the more
significant below:


\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{nullable fields}: there are many instances when a field
value may or may not be present, and we found it useful to be able to
indicate that a given value is null. This option is implemented by
generating a hidden boolean column that determines if the value is null.

\item \textbf{double scale}: often, the full precision of double
values is not needed. In this case, it is possible to get
significantly more compression by zeroing unimportant lower
order bits by scaling and rounding. This option lets the user specify
a specific scale factor for the values stored.

\item \textbf{relative packing}: specify that a given field be packed
relative to another, using delta encoding. This option is also useful
for timestamps and index values that may be large, but are only small
relative to each other. This enables fewer bits to be used to store a
given value.

\item \textbf{unique packing}: ensures that every string (arbitrary
length binary data) field is stored only once. If a given data set
contains many repeated values, this option can significantly increase
the effective compression ratio (compression algorithms only partially
remove duplicate data).

\item \textbf{time handling}: dealing with time turns out to be very
challenging.  One of our initial attempts involved using doubles to
store time values because they were logically represented that way in
one of the traces.  Unfortunately, we discovered that while time
values that are zero based work very well, as in the original format,
once those values are scaled to use the UNIX epoch, there is no longer
enough remaining precision to store the time in microseconds.  We
attempted to work around this problem by storing double values offset
from some base value, but this approach meant that writing analysis
programs was very difficult as they had to handle base values that
potentially changed across files.  Our second approach was to use 64
bit or 32 bit fixed point values in units native to the source data,
e.g. nanoseconds for NFS attribute times, or microseconds for packet
times from pcap.  While this meant we could easily have sufficient
precision to represent the source data, analysis had to interpret a
comment field intended for human consumption to determine the time
representation.  This became a problem when we got improved packet
capture technology that captured time in units of $2^{-32}$
seconds\footnote{The maximum precision possible that can represent the
full range of UNIX time values}.  Lately, we have added explicit
support for units and epoch to the dataseries format, and a time field
that can use the units and epoch to do conversions.  Analysis are
written to operate over the ``raw'' time format, and then they use the
field to convert to more normal formats for printing.  If the analysis
needs to calculate windows, it can convert a normal format to a
``raw'' format.  For example to calculate mean bytes per 30 second
window, an analysis would first convert 30 seconds into the raw
format, it would then accumulate values for that interval, output the
mean and reset the statistic.  The use of units and epoch also allows
us to print out time values in a nicer human readable form regardless
of the input type.  To deal with older files that are missing units
and epoch, we added the ability to specify units and epochs based on
the extent type, extent version and field names.

\item \textbf{versioning}: ...

One addition we did try, and later rejected, was that of extending a
double fields precision by allowing the specification of a base value.
This was introduced when we realized that storing nanosecond precision
time values, using the unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970),
was not possible with a single double. Using this option, it became
possible to specific a base value that indicated the time the events
in the data file start, with the value stored indicating the time in
nanoseconds since. Unfortunately, experience showed that this option
was less useful than hoped for. It proved difficult and confusing for
those developing analyses to deal with, particularly in the case where
multiple files, each with different bases, were being used. Arithmetic
on values of this type was complicated and inefficient. Ultimately, we
deprecated this option, in favor of other time representations,
dependant on the domain. For many of our purposes (traces derived from
computer systems), we have found a single 64-bit integer value, with
the top 32 bits representing seconds, and the lower 32 bits
representing fractional seconds (in $2^{-32}$ increments) to be
effective. In theory, if one wished to represent all possible time
values (Plank time granularity over the age of the universe), over 200
bits would be necessary, but we have not yet had to introduce
measurements with this level of precision!


\subsection{Programming model}
%{\bf TODO: maybe this should be a section}
Four general functionalities are supported by DataSeries:
reading a DataSeries file, 
analyzing the data in a DataSeries file,
writing a DataSeries file,
and writing an alternative output format (e.g., CSV).
These functionalities meet all of the typical needs for
users of structured serial data, and thus facilitate
the usability (property 5) of DataSeries.

There are three key concepts in the C++ API provided by
DataSeries. The first is that of an \textit{ExtentSeries}, which is an
iterator over the rows in at least one extent.  Iterators in
dataseries are similar to iterators in relational
databases~\cite{graefeQueryProcessing93}, but they typically operate
in bulk over an entire extent in a single pass to improve access
efficiency.  Iterators in dataseries are also not required to operate
over extents of identical type.  An iterator specifies its
compatibility for types.  Normally compatibility is exact type
compatibility, but it can also be loose, which means that the types
are compatible if all the fields can be found.  The second key concept
is that of a \textit{module}, which accepts a series of extents
processes them and passes them to downstream modules.  Similar to
River~\cite{river99}, modules can have multiple inputs if they are
joining together two different series.  The ability to add
functionality in a modular fashion enhances the flexibility (property
3) of DataSeries.  


Analysis programs generally have a main program that builds a sequence
of modules to perform multiple analysis in a single pass over the
data. Each module processes an extent at a time, and iterates over
each of the rows in the extent.  For easier usability, a row analysis
module can be used that will call a processRow() function on each row.
The {\tt dstypes2cxx} program will automatically generate the boilerplate
needed for a module to be used as a row analysis module.
For efficiency reasons, the transfer of extents between
modules is a transfer of ownership, i.e., the module that returns an
extent must not continue to access it. We are considering relaxing
this constraint in the future to allow multiple modules to read-share
a single extent at the same time so that we can increase the available
parallelism for analysis without increasing the memory requirements.
%Each module can iterate over the rows in
%the extent by putting it into a series and using the series iterator
%to select the row and the fields to access rows in that series.
DataSeries also provides modules which exploit parallelism in
operations, such as decompressing or compressing and writing extents
to disk in parallel, which increases the access efficency on
multi-core systems.  This improvement is very important for
compression, which is usually slow, but can also be important for
simple analysis that run faster than a single core can decompress.

The DataSeries source distribution contains numerous other built-in
general modules, for example, ones that convert extents to text, and
ones that perform simple versions of the SQL select/group-by
statement.  We also have converters from various input formats (pcap,
log file, SRT~\cite{SRT}) into a DataSeries representation.  Finally
there are type specific analysis for converted NFS~\cite{NFS},
LSF~\cite{LSF} and logical/physical disk volume traces.  More detailed
information on these modules and programming examples are available in
the DataSeries technical report~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot} and
the source distribution.

\section{Performance results}\label{sec:results}

%{\bf TODO: I wonder if we should rename these ``Harvard'' traces
%rather than Ellard?}
%{\bf TODO: add sections here to fill up space somewhat}
%We performed various experiments to measure the effectiveness of
%DataSeries' compression techniques, and then further compared
%DataSeries to data encoding and analysis using MySQL, CSV, CStore,
%Dan Ellard's NFS traces~\cite{ellard03}, and the 1998 World Cup Web
%traces~\cite{ita-wcweb98} for compression ratio and analysis execution speed.
%Due to space constraints we give example results from our
%comparison with Ellard and comment on highlights of our other results.

% added by Martin
In this section we provide examples to illustrate quantitatively the 
effectiveness of DataSeries.  
Section~\ref{sec:scale} describes how we have used DataSeries to store 
and analyze a large dataset on a modest system.
Section~\ref{sec:efficiency} demonstrates the flexibility provided
by DataSeries for selecting between storage and access efficiency needs.
Section~\ref{sec:ellard} provides a case study which illustrates
both the reusability of DataSeries and its access efficiency compared
to existing work.
Additional examples and comparisons can be found in the
DataSeries technical report~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.

\subsection{Scalability}\label{sec:scale}

The largest dataset we have is a trace of NFS traffic to and from
busy enterprise file servers.
The primary extent type 
in this data is the common records which store information about each
of the 200 billion request and reply messages. We have secondary tables that
store information about each packet captured, operations that included
file attributes, read and write requests and mount requests.  The total dataset
is about 5TB.

As a demonstration of the real-life performance of
DataSeries, consider the following example.  Utilizing our NFS
trace, we performed an analysis of the throughput
%effects if servers were instead accessed across a WAN.
% MFA: need to change above description of trace if we say servers
effects if the server was instead accessed across a WAN.
The analysis read in 45.5 GB of data (406 GB when uncompressed), and
processed 7.6 billion records (each record corresponds to an NFS
transaction).  Using a 2003 model two-way 2.8 GHz Xeon server, the
entire data set was processed in 11,263 wall clock seconds (about 3
hours), or roughly 675,000 rows per second while performing a set of complex
analyses. \fix{need to get current performance numbers}

\subsection{Examining storage and access efficiency}\label{sec:efficiency}

We have performed extensive experiments on the effect of compression
on the performance of analysis~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.  We
summarize the results below:

\begin{itemize}

\item For archival storage, or preparation for network distribution,
bzip2~\cite{BZIP} compression with large extents (16-64MB) makes the
most sense.  Keeping the size at most 64MB allows for some parallelism
during compression, and later decompression, but extracts almost all
of the potential compression available.  It may be useful to leave on
gzip compression as gzip occasionally gets better compression that
BZIP.

\item For analysis with sufficient disk bandwidth, lzo~\cite{LZO} with
small extents (96-128KB) gets the maximum performance.  The size of
the extents is somewhat below the L2 cache size as there needs to be
sufficient cache space to hold the entire uncompressed extent, some of
the compressed data while it is uncompressed, and any additional
program state.

\item With more constrained disk bandwidth, gzip~\cite{GZIP} with
small extents is better than lzo as it trades a 10-30% reduction in
decompression rate for a 10-40% improvement in compression; if disk
bandwidth is a limiter than the improved compression is more valuable.
The additional compression from longer extents is minimal, and bzip2
while compressing much faster, decompresses so much slower that only a
highly imbalanced system would benefit from bzip2 decompression.

\item For online compression of data, lzf~\cite{LZF} with small to
moderate size extents is the only choice.  Lzf compresses at roughly
100MB/s which is about 10$\times$ faster than gzip at level 1.
Moderate sized extents may be a benefit if the data has unique strings
as the unique packing option is very fast and gets very good
compression.  Otherwise staying within the L2 cache remains a
priority.

\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Ellard Traces}\label{sec:ellard}
\subsection{A case study}\label{sec:ellard}

In an effort to experiment with using DataSeries to represent and
analyze traces generated by other people, we converted the NFS
traces used by Ellard \textit{et al.}~\cite{ellard03} into DataSeries.  
The ``Ellard traces''
were originally stored as compressed text files, one record per line.
The first part of each line is a series of fixed fields, followed by a
set of key-value pairs, and finally some debugging information.  As
part of their tools, there is also a scanning program which reads the
trace files and outputs summary information for a trace.

Our evaluation came in two parts.  First, we wrote programs that
converted between the two formats.  The reversable conversion
guaranteed that we were properly preserving all of the information.
We found that the DataSeries files were on average 0.77x the size of
the original files when both were compressed using gzip.  The
compression improvements came as a result of the unique string
packing, delta encoding, and the elimination of the key fields through
the use of fixed field names and representing null fields in a single
bit before generic compression.

Second, we
wrote an analysis program that implemented the first three examples in
the README that came with the tools.  The first three examples were
all variants of a ``select count(*) group by field'' query.
We found that our analysis
program ran about 76x faster on those data files than the text
analysis program that came with the distribution.  We also found that
if we utilized lzo compression, which decompresses more quickly than
gzip, our analysis program ran about 107x faster, in exchange for
slightly larger (1.14x) data files.  This also illustrates how
DataSeries can be optimized for a given purpose (e.g., greater
compression for archival storage versus faster decompression for more
efficient analysis). The detailed experimental setup can be found in
the DataSeries technical report~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.

\fix{Jeff said ``What huh'' next to the beginning of this; dunno what to do about that.}
Table~\ref{tab:summary} presents the summary results, showing the
significant speedup and reduction in CPU time that can be achieved by
using DataSeries.  The different sizes specified after the compression
algorithm for the DataSeries rows are the extent sizes. 
For example, ds-gz-512k corresponds to DataSeries with gzip
compression and a 512 KB extent size.
The substantial increase in system time for dealing
with large extents for bzip2 is a result of glibc's use of mmap/munmap
for large allocations.  Every extent results in a separate pair of
mmap/munmap calls to the kernel, hence a substantial amount of page
zeroing in the kernel, and hence a large increase in the system time 
used during the analysis run (e.g. 11.82s vs 1.14s of system time for 
bz2-16M vs lzo-64k).

\subsection{Other results}\label{sec:otherresults}

We have performed a number of other experiments that demonstrate
DataSeries' benefits. Due to space considerations, we will only
describe them briefly. One study of data compression showed that for a
relatively large disk I/O trace, DataSeries provides superior disk
space utilization; stored in DataSeries, the trace consumed 1.9GB of
disk space, but 14GB in CSV format and 8.5GB as a MySQL
database. Using the same trace in a series of analyses showed that
DataSeries delivers results 6-7x faster than both formats.

\fix{add world cup, something about nfs, something about dsstatgroupby vs srt.}

Our results and experience with DataSeries have also illustrated some
of the tradeoffs between generality and performance. We have found
that by adding various type-specific functionality, we can
significantly improve performance. For instance, for the analysis of
the World Cup traces, we added new accessors that did not check for
nullable fields, and found that we decreased CPU time by
8\%. Similarly, we found that we could ``group'' multiple analyses
into a single routine (therefore only needing to pass over the data
once), which can decrease the overall time taken by the same
factor. This si especially effective when compared to the time taken
in a more general solution (e.g. SQL queries) which cannot be combined
in this manner. The primary tradeoff is the added complexity, effort
and time and time involved in writing and using such type-specific
accessors, which may not be worth while for one-shot analyses.

\section{Lessons learned}\label{sec:lessonslearned}

\fix{this needs to become a summary section of highlights from lessons
learned. The list below are just ideas for this - all of them are discussed
in (varying) detail in the body of the paper}

Trick with cast to make data access fast: The format is designed for
efficient access. Values are packed so that once an extent is read in,
an analysis can iterate over the rows simply by increasing a single
counter, as if for an array of a structure.  Individual values are
accessed by an offset from that counter and a C++ cast.  applicable to
anyone storing similar data (RPC, streaming DB...)

Delta encoding via the pack\_relative field option saves space
with small cost.

Unique packing saves strings only once, improving on runlength
compression by having effectively an infinite window size for specific
strings.

Parallel compression and decompression improves performance
dramatically on multicore machines as shown by the 4x lower wall clock
time compared to cpu time on a 4 core machine in the ellard experiments.

Bulk processing of extents amortizes compression and decompression
costs over a fixed configurable amount of space.

Byte swapping if necessary is automatically performed.

Making data analyses type specific improves performance greatly.
Consider the analyses of NFS data.  When new accessors were added that
did not support nullable fields, performance improved by x amount.
Compared to SQL, and dsstatgroupby type specific performance can be as
much as x faster.  However, writing type specific accessors is more
time consuming, so for one shot analyses it may not be worth the
effort.

Discuss time field issues and why the field base value was a bad idea
and where we are with archival time representation and functional time
representation now.

field base value: applicable only to double fields,
this was used to gain precision for double values. This extra degree
of flexibility was introduced when we realized that storing nanosecond
precision time values, using the unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC on January
1, 1970), was not possible with a single double. Using this option, it
is possible to specific a base value that indicates the time the
events in the data file start, and the value stored indicates the time
in nanoseconds since.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have described DataSeries, a data format that enables the efficient
and flexible storage of structured serial data. This type of data is
used in numerous applications in all areas of computing and
science. We have identified the properties required for a system that
processes such data, and shown through a series of experiments and
comparisons to other systems that DataSeries meets satisfies these
properties. In particular, DataSeries offers significant performance
and storage efficiency benefits.  
% For these reasons, DataSeries is the
% recommended trace for the SNIA IOTTA technical working group.

We have also described the various lessons learned while designing and
implementing DataSeries. A general theme from this has been that, when
dealing with very large quantities of data, with a particular workload,
there are huge performance, efficiency and reliability gains to be made
by giving up a relatively small amount of generality and flexibility. 

Overall, we believe that DataSeries should be considered for use in
any application that processes structured serial data. DataSeries is
open source, and available for download from
