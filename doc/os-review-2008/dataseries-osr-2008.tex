\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Traces, recordings and measurements taken from computer systems,
networks and scientific infrastructure are vitally important for a
large variety of tasks. In every area of computer system design,
traces from existing systems have been used to validate hypotheses,
test assumptions and estimate performance. This is true of I/O
subsystems~\cite{IORef,Ji03,Uysal03}, processor
systems~\cite{ProcRef}, network systems~\cite{NetRef} and memory
systems~\cite{MemRef}, among others. Traces and logs are also
extremely useful for fault-finding, auditing and debugging purposes
~\cite{DebugRef}. Traces composed of failure data have been used to
determine system reliability~\cite{ReliabilityRef, Schroeder07,
Pinheiro07}. Trend analyses of performance information is a core
operation of various management tools~\cite{MgmtRef}. Scientific and
medical instrumentation can also generate large amounts of
data~\cite{SciRef}, which also needs to be stored, filtered and
analyzed.

The data stored in each of these diverse uses is {\it structured
serial data}, which we define as a series of records, each record
having a specified structure (i.e., containing the same set of
variables). Structured serial data has four defining characteristics:
its structure is record-oriented; it is typically written only once,
and is read many times; it is usually ordered
in some manner, e.g., chronologically; and it is typically read
sequentially.  We have designed and built DataSeries, an on-disk 
data format, run-time library, and set of
tools that is optimized for storing and analyzing this type of data.
We show that the performance of DataSeries
exceeds the performance of common trace formats and databases by at
least a factor of two, and in some cases up to an order of
magnitude. DataSeries also requires far less disk space (factors vary
from 4X to 8X in test data sets).

% which we define as an ordered series of records that share a common
% structure.  This type of data commonly occurs as trace data in
% computer systems, but since the format is essentially ordered RDBMS
% tables, the need to maintain and analyze such data occurs in a large
% number of scientific fields.

There are five key properties that are desired of a data format
and analysis system for structured serial data:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Storage efficiency}: the data should be stored in as few
bytes as possible. There are several driving factors behind this
requirement. Firstly, the amount of data stored can be large (we have
I/O traces comprising billions of records), and despite rapidly
decreasing storage prices, the cost to store data can still be
considerable, particularly when the data must be kept for long periods
of time. Secondly, we have learnt that one of the primary factors
behind analysis efficiency is the speed at which data can be
retrieved. Regardless of the storage technology used, more highly
compressed data can substantially speed access times.

\item \textbf{Access efficiency}: accessing, interpreting and encoding
trace data, whether reading or writing, should make efficient use of
CPU and memory resources. From experience and experimental analysis, we
have learnt that the second major factor determining analysis efficiency is the
CPU overheads of intepreting data once it has been read off disk. 

\item \textbf{Flexibility}: adding additional fields should not affect
users of the trace data.  Removing or modifying data fields should
only affect users who use those fields and the system should support
catching incorrect usage.  Further, the format should not constrain
the type of data being stored, and should allow multiple record types
in a single file. Again, experience has taught us that formats that
are not flexible lead to severe maintenance issues for both the format
interpretation code and analysis systems.

\item \textbf{Self-describing}: the data set should contain the
metadata that describes the data. This is another experience-driven
requirement, as we have had problems in trying to interpret and use
trace data from other organizations, and maintaining organizational
knowledge of our own metadata over time.

\item \textbf{(Re)Usability}: the data format should have an
associated programming interface that is both expressive and easy to
use. In particular the user model of the data and its analysis should
be easy to describe and the interface to it should easily allow for
common operations (e.g., scanning an entire data set, and processing
specific fields only).

\end{enumerate}

Although numerous tracing and measurement systems have been developed
over the last 20-30 years, we are not aware of any that meet all of
these requirements. We analyze some of these in our description of
related work (Section~\ref{sec:related}).

We provide four primary contributions in this paper.  First, we
introduce DataSeries, a data format and associated library, which was
specifically designed to meet the five key properties discussed above,
and relate some of the experiences that led us to make various
design decisions. 
Second, we discuss how DataSeries can support very large data sets
(e.g., hundreds of billions of records) on modest systems.  Third, we
describe how we have used DataSeries in practice to store a wide
variety of data types.  Fourth, we demonstrate the performance and
storage efficiency of DataSeries in a set of controlled experiments,
using empirical data sets. 

Since DataSeries software is publicly available (under a BSD software
license), and given the benefits of DataSeries that we demonstrate, we
argue that DataSeries should be considered for use by any application
that needs to store large amounts of structured serial data. Indeed
the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) I/O traces tools
and analysis (IOTTA) technical working group~\cite{iotta-website} has
chosen DataSeries as a standard format for I/O trace data.
% and is
% currently specifying the semantics for I/O traces encoded using DataSeries.

existing storage technologies relative to DataSeries.

on-disk and in-memory formats, and introduces the programming model.

DataSeries. Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} concludes the

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

We classify the related work into three categories:
those that use a customized binary format, those that use a
text-based format, and relational database systems. 
For more complete comparisons including performance
results, please refer to~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.

Custom binary formats are usually serialized or directly written
versions of an in-memory data structure.  As such, they usually
achieve properties 1 and 2, and fail to achieve properties 3-5,
although as we will show in the results, unless the authors are
careful they can also fail to achieve property 2.

Text formats such as Column Separated Value (CSV) can
%often (but far from always)
achieve properties 3 and 4. XML achieves properties 3-5.  However,
they fail to achieve property 1, and can fail property 2 by multiple
orders of magnitude.  Even very tuned CSV
implementations can only get to within 2-7x the
access-efficiency of DataSeries, and 4-7x for the storage
efficiency.
% (See the DataSeries technical 
%report~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot} for these results.)
%{\bf TODO: need to re-do these experiments at least to
%measure the file sizes, and potentially with Tfrac text files,
%although I suspect people would use sec.usec in a block I/O trace}

Relational databases achieve properties 3, 4, and 5. RDBMS's were
designed to handle updates, so do very limited compression drastically
hurting their storage efficiency (property 1).  Our results show
$>$10x improvement on storage efficiency for DataSeries over
MySQL. 
%{\bf TODO: check the exact sizes, should be around there.}
Similarly, the generality of SQL can hurt it.  Even for fairly simple
queries running entirely on in-memory data, DataSeries runs 2-7x
faster than MySQL. 
%{\bf TODO: re-do these numbers with parallel
%decompression, etc.}  
Retrieving the data for a more complicated
calculation on the client would further slow the relative performance.

\section{Design}\label{sec:design}

\subsection{Data Format}
DataSeries' data model is conceptually very similar to that used by
relational databases.  Logically, a DataSeries file is composed of an
ordered sequence of {\it records}, where each record is composed from
a set of {\it fields}. Each field has a {\it field-type} (e.g.,
integer, string, double, boolean) and a name. A DataSeries record is
analogous to a row in a conventional relational database. We call the
type of a row the {\it extent-type} because an {\it extent} contains a
collection of rows with the same fields and field-types. An extent is
analagous to a database table.

A single DataSeries file comprises a collection of extents
(potentially with different extent-types), plus a header and
extent-type extent at the beginning of the file, and an index extent
and trailer at the end of the file. The header on a DataSeries file 
contains the DataSeries
file version, and check values that enable the reader to determine the
endianness encodings of the data types.  DataSeries files are always
written out using the native formats of the writing system. This 
typically minimizes byte-swapping overheads, as the architecture 
reading the files is almost always the same as the architecture reading
the files. The library transparently converts in the rare cases this
is not true, and DataSeries files can be explicitly ``repacked'' if desired. 

The
extent-type extent contains records with a single string-valued field,
each of which contains an XML specification that defines the
extent-types of all the other extents in the file. 
{\bf TODO: say why XML}

The trailer
consists of the offset and size (after compression) of the index
extent.  The offset is used to read the index extent, which has two
fields, an extent-type and an offset, to allow direct access to
extents of a single type. Storing the index and trailer at the end
of the file enable efficient writing, since writing applications will
often not know, a priori, what the final extent sizes will be, so space 
for the index cannot be allocated until after the extents have been written.

The data extents themselves consist of a header, followed by the fixed
size data and the variable sized data.  Both fixed and variable sized
data may be compressed, using any one of a number of standard
compression algorithms~\cite{GZIP,BZIP,LZF,LZO}.  The header contains
metadata about the data in the extent, such as the compressed sizes of
the fixed and variable data, the number of records in the extent, the
uncompressed size of the variable length data, the compression mode,
the extent-type of the extent, and checksums of the extent before and
after compression to guard against hardware and software errors.
Checksum validation can be disabled during extent reading to improve
performance at the cost of reduced reliability.

As we initially built DataSeries prototypes, we realized the need to
add options that control various aspects of the field and extent
descriptions in order to meet the storage and access efficiency and
flexibility requirements.  While space precludes a full description
(see~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}), we describe some of the more
significant below:

{\bf TODO: this probably shouldn't be an enumerated list}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{nullable fields}: there are many instances when a field
value may or may not be present, and we found it useful to be able to
indicate that a given value is null. This option is implemented by
generating a boolean column that determines if the value is null.

\item \textbf{field base value}: applicable only to double fields,
this was used to gain precision for double values. This extra degree
of flexibility was introduced when we realized that storing nanosecond
precision time values, using the unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC on January
1, 1970), was not possible with a single double. Using this option, it
is possible to specific a base value that indicates the time the
events in the data file start, and the value stored indicates the time
in nanoseconds since.

\item \textbf{double scale}: often, the full precision of double
values is not needed. In this case, it is possible to get
significantly more compression by zeroing the pseudo-random lower
order bits by scaling and rounding. This option lets the user specify
a specific scale factor for the values stored.

\item \textbf{relative packing}: specify that a given field be packed
relative to another, using delta encoding. This option is also useful
for timestamps and index values that may be large, but are only small
relative to each other. This enables fewer bits to be used to store a
given value.

\item \textbf{unique packing}: ensures that every string (arbitrary
length binary data) field is stored only once. If a given data set
contains many repeated values, this option can significantly increase
the effective compression ratio (compression algorithms only partially
remove duplicate data).

\end{enumerate}

Detailed explanation of all options can be found in the DataSeries
technical report~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.

\subsection{Programming model}
%{\bf TODO: maybe this should be a section}
Four general functionalities are supported by DataSeries:
reading a DataSeries file, 
analyzing the data in a DataSeries file,
writing a DataSeries file,
and writing an alternative output format (e.g., CSV).
These functionalities meet all of the typical needs for
users of structured serial data, and thus facilitate
the usability (property 5) of DataSeries.

There are two key concepts in the C++ API provided by DataSeries. The
first is that of an \textit{ExtentSeries}, which is an iterator over
the rows in at least one extent-type-compatible extent.  
%When reading
%a file, the ExtentSeries is initialized with the extent, each row is
%iterated over, and then the series is reset to use the next extent.
The second key concept is that of a \textit{module}, which provides
functionality similar to the modules in River~\cite{river99}, and the
iterator model~\cite{graefeQueryProcessing93} in relational databases.
The ability to add functionality in a modular fashion enhances
the flexibility (property 3) of DataSeries.

DataSeries also provides modules that enhance the access efficiency
(property 2).
With DataSeries, each module processes an extent at a time, and
iterates over each of the rows in the extent.  In the standard
iterator model, a tree of modules are created and each module provides
a {\tt getNext()} operation that reads the next row from that module.
This model is inefficient as each row is handled as a separate data
structure.  To address this, DataSeries provides a 
bulk iterator model which amortizes the cost of reading each
row by collecting multiple rows together.  The row analysis module
used above then calls the processRow() function on each row.  For
efficiency reasons, the transfer of extents between modules is a
transfer of ownership, i.e., the module that returns an extent must
not continue to access it, although we are considering relaxing this
constraint in the future.  
{\bf TODO: need to explain why, or delete the relaxation comment.}
%Each module can iterate over the rows in
%the extent by putting it into a series and using the series iterator
%to select the row and the fields to access rows in that series.
DataSeries also provides modules which exploit parallelism in operations,
such as decompressing and analyzing data or compressing and writing
extents to disk in parallel, which increases the access effiency
(property 2) on multi-core and SMP systems.

The DataSeries source distribution contains numerous other built-in 
general modules as well as many analysis modules, for analyzing
specific data types such as NFS, LSF and logical/physical disk volume
traces.  More detailed information on these modules is available 
in~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}, as well as the source distribution.
A programming example is also provided in~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.

\section{Performance Results}\label{sec:results}

{\bf TODO: I wonder if we should rename these ``Harvard'' traces
rather than Ellard?}
{\bf TODO: add sections here to fill up space somewhat
We performed various experiments to measure the effectiveness of
DataSeries' compression techniques, and then further compared
DataSeries to data encoding and analysis using MySQL, CSV, CStore,
Dan Ellard's NFS traces~\cite{ellard03}, and the 1998 World Cup Web
traces~\cite{ita-wcweb98} for compression ratio and analysis execution speed.
Due to space constraints we give example results from our
comparison with Ellard and comment on highlights of our other results.
  More complete coverage can be found in the
DataSeries technical report~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.

\subsection{Ellard Traces}\label{sec:ellard}

In an effort to experiment with using DataSeries to represent and
analyze traces generated by other people, we converted the Ellard NFS
traces into DataSeries.  These traces
were originally stored as compressed text files, one record per line.
The first part of each line is a series of fixed fields, followed by a
set of key-value pairs, and finally some debugging information.  As
part of the tools, there is also a scanning program which reads the
trace files and outputs summary information for a trace.

Our evaluation came in two parts.  First, we wrote programs that
converted between the two formats.  The reversable conversion
guaranteed that we were properly preserving all of the information.
We found that the DataSeries files were on average 0.77x the size of
the original files when both were compressed using gzip.  Second, we
wrote an analysis program that implemented the first three examples in
the README that came with the tools.  We found that our analysis
program ran about 76x faster on those data files than the text
analysis program that came with the distribution.  We also found that
if we utilized lzo compression which decompresses more quickly than
gzip, our analysis program ran about 107x faster, in exchange for
slightly larger (1.14x) data files.  This also illustrates how
DataSeries can be optimized for a given purpose (e.g., greater
compression for archival storage versus faster decompression for more
efficient analysis). The detailed experimental setup can be found in
the DataSeries technical report~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.


% \subsubsection{Performance comparison}
%
% For the performance comparison, we implemented a subset of the
% analysis performed by Ellard's \texttt{nfsscan} program. In particular one
% that can perform the first three of the five example questions
% presented in the EXAMPLES file that comes with Ellard's trace tools.
% This analysis turned out to be very simple, it is just counting the
% number of requests performed of each client of each type.  We chose to
% implement this over the integer operation id, rather than the string,
% and so wrote a short table that converted NFSv2 and NFSv3 operation
% id's into a common space. The detailed experimental setup can be found in the DataSeries
% technical report~\cite{DSTechnicalReportSnapshot}.

Table~\ref{tab:summary} presents the summary results, showing the
significant speedup and reduction in CPU time that can be achieved by
using DataSeries.  The different sizes specified after the compression
algorithm for the DataSeries rows are the extent sizes. 
For example, ds-gz-512k corresponds to DataSeries with gzip
compression and a 512 KB extent size.
The substantial increase in system time for dealing
with large extents for bzip2 is a result of glibc's use of mmap/munmap
for large allocations.  Every extent results in a separate pair of
mmap/munmap calls to the kernel and hence a substantial about of page
zeroing in the kernel.  
% The detailed measurements can be found 
% in the DataSeries distribution in \texttt{doc/tr/ellard-details.tex}.

\subsection{Other results}\label{sec:otherresults}

We have performed a number of other experiments that demonstrate
DataSeries' benefits. Due to space considerations, we will only
describe them briefly. One study of data compression showed that for a
relatively large disk I/O trace, DataSeries provides superior disk
space utilization; stored in DataSeries, the trace consumed 1.9GB of
disk space, but 14GB in CSV format and 8.5GB as a MySQL
database. Using the same trace in a series of analyses showed that
DataSeries delivers results 6-7x faster than both formats.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have described DataSeries, a data format that enables the efficient
and flexible storage of structured serial data. This type of data is
used in numerous applications in all areas of computing and
science. We have identified the properties required for a system that
processes such data, and shown through a series of experiements and
comparisons to other systems that DataSeries meets satisfies these
properties. In particular, DataSeries offers significant performance
and storage efficiency benefits.  For these reasons, DataSeries is the
recommended trace for the SNIA IOTTA technical working group.
