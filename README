COMPILATION:

0) You need to build and install Lintel.

1a) Get source code (via version control, inside HP only):
   [ -d ~/.monotone ] || mkdir ~/.monotone
   mtn -d ~/.monotone/ssd.db db init
   mtn -d ~/.monotone/ssd.db pull usi.hpl.hp.com ssd.hpl.hp.com/DataSeries\*
   [ -d ~/projects ] || mkdir ~/projects
   cd ~/projects
   mtn -d ~/.monotone/ssd.db co -b ssd.hpl.hp.com/DataSeries DataSeries
   cd DataSeries
   # monotone intro: https://twiki.hpl.hp.com/bin/view/StorageSystems/MonotoneIntro

1b) Get source code (via tarball, from anywhere):
   [ -d ~/projects ] || mkdir ~/projects
   cd ~/projects
   # visit http://tesla.hpl.hp.com/opensource/ to find the most recent version
   wget http://tesla.hpl.hp.com/opensource/DataSeries-2007-11-07.tar.bz2
   bunzip2 -c < DataSeries-2007-11-07.tar.bz2 | tar xvvf -
   mv DataSeries-2007-11-07 DataSeries

2) configure the package:
   mkdir -p ~/build/optimize/DataSeries
   cd ~/build/optimize/DataSeries
   ccmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-prefix>] ~/projects/DataSeries
   # we use an install prefix like ~/build/optimize; it needs to be the
   # same as for Lintel.

3) compile and install the package:
   cd ~/build/optimize/DataSeries:
   make && make test && make install
