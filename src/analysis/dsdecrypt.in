=head1 NAME

dsdecrypt - descrypt dataseries files encrypted using the method in nettrace2ds

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % dsdecrypt < input > output
 % dsdecrypt input...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dsdecrypt looks for entries in the file which are a run of hexadecimal characters.  When it finds
such strings, it then attempts to decrypt the strings using the separately entered password.  If
the decryption succeeds and the interior value passes the internal hash check, then the assumption
is that the string was actually encrypted, in which case it is printed out after decryption.
Otherwise it is assumed to be a false positive and the original string is printed out.
